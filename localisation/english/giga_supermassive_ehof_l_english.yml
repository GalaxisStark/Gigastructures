Now, if we are to go through with this, several different options have been brought forward.\n\nFirst, we could play it safe and simply send an uncrewed science ship to probe the anomaly and retrieve as much data as possible. if the anomaly turns out to be hostile or dangerous, we wouldn't lose much and it would provide us with valuable insight on how to best prepare for its arrival.\n\nAlternatively, a more brazen option would be to send a fleet to intercept the anomaly and perhaps destroy it before it reaches us, but we really have no idea how powerful it actually is and so there is no guarantee of success.\n\nAnd last, but not least, some argue that bothering with sending an expensive fleet would be little more than a waste of resources, and instead advocate for us to send a powerful explosive device through, which would be a risk-free way of attempting to destroy or at least repel the anomaly by diverting its course."

And the data it sent back has confirmed our empire's worst fear: the object is not natural.\n\nIt is a ship! More precisely a gargantuan vessel of utterly alien design, comprised of large concentric rings arranged around some sort of high-energy core.\n\nUnfortunately there was not enough time to understand what the purpose of its components were and most of the data beamed back is currently unusable due to a critical lack of context. Fortunately our scientists believe that we might be able to complete our analysis once the anomaly actually arrives, but for now, we should prepare for the worst."

No more than a few hundred kilometers across, it could be encompassed within the breadth of our warfleet several times over. Whatever the case, it matters not as the fleet opens fire, cannons big and small showering the anomaly in ordnance powerful enough to level most of §Y[ROOT.Capital.GetName]§!.\n\nBut nothing happens. The anomaly, utterly unfazed by our intervention, continues onwards, our fleet struggling to catch up. And so we open fire once more, but this time, there is a response as the anomaly suddenly stops. In an instant, energy readings spike, and... all is quiet.\n\nOur high command scrambles to regain contact, receiving nothing but silence. The conclusion is clear: whatever, or whoever that thing is, we must be ready to deploy everything's we've got against it when it finally arrives."
