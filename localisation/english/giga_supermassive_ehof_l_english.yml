Now, if we are to go through with this, several different options have been brought forward.\n\nFirst, we could play it safe and simply send an uncrewed science ship to probe the anomaly and retrieve as much data as possible. if the anomaly turns out to be hostile or dangerous, we wouldn't lose much and it would provide us with valuable insight on how to best prepare for its arrival.\n\nAlternatively, a more brazen option would be to send a fleet to intercept the anomaly and perhaps destroy it before it reaches us, but we really have no idea how powerful it actually is and so there is no guarantee of success.\n\nAnd last, but not least, some argue that bothering with sending an expensive fleet would be little more than a waste of resources, and instead advocate for us to send a powerful explosive device through, which would be a risk-free way of attempting to destroy or at least repel the anomaly by diverting its course."
